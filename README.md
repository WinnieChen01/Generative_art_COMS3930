# Module 1: Generative art 
## Description
The generative art installation using ESP32 TTGO T-Display is a project in the Creative Embedded Systems (COMS BC 3930) course taught by Professor Mark Santolucito in Spring 2023. We started from getting to learn ESP32 TTGO T-Display, setting up Arduino and upload example files, to creating our own program on Arduino to visualize a text of our choice on the screen of the ESP32.
